# snakeGame

This is a remake of the popular snake game in which the player is a snake and eats food to grow bigger and get a higher score whilst evading obstacles and its own body. This remake was made using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript with no external libraries. Users can use the WASD or the arrow keys to move the snake. For mobile devices, there are buttons on the screen.
